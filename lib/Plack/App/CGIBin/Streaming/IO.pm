=head1 NAME

Plack::App::CGIBin::Streaming::IO - a helper PerlIO layer for
Plack::App::CGIBin::Streaming

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 binmode HANDLE, 'via(Plack::App::CGIBin::Streaming::IO)';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a L<PerlIO::via> layer to capture all the output
written to C<HANDLE>. It uses the global variable
C<$Plack::App::CGIBin::Streaming::R> and passes the output via the
C<print_content> method.

A flush operation is passed by calling the C<flush> method.

Attempts to read from a file handle configured with this layer result in an
exception.
